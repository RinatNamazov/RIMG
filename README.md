# RIMG

An example of a plugin developed to decrypt (and potentially uncompress) files from IMG archives at runtime.
And also applications to pack IMG archive.
In this example, the encryption is quite heavy, which will cause a significant drop in FPS.

Usage:
```
rimg_app <input_file_path> [output_file_path]
```
And install `rimg_plugin.asi` in the game folder.
